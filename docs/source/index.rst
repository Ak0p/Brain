Welcome to BFMC Computer Project's documentation!
==================================================

This project describes the given code for the RPi platform. It includes the startup code and the documentation for the provided API's, 
which will help you interact with our V2X systems. The start-up code helps in the first steps and can give some ideas for implementation. 
The project uses concepts of multi-processing and distribuited system and it implements a basic flexible structure, which can be extended 
with new features. The concept and architectures are specified in the introduction. On the layer, you can find the code documentation itself.
